Author: Anthony Bishop  
Date: 2026-01-12  
Status: Draft Standard v0.1

Mainstay is a proposed protocol for cryptographically anchoring Kaspa’s historical state to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Mainstay does not move assets, issue tokens, provide execution, or alter the consensus rules of either network.

It exists solely to provide verifiable historical finality by committing Kaspa state summaries into Bitcoin.

This repository contains the original draft specification and supporting documents for the Mainstay protocol concept.
