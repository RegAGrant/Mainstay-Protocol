# The Mainstay Manifesto

## Purpose

Mainstay exists to provide cryptographic historical finality for Kaspa by anchoring its state to the Bitcoin blockchain.

It does not exist to replace Bitcoin.  
It does not exist to compete with Kaspa.  
It does not exist to create a new monetary system.

Mainstay exists to strengthen what already works.

---

## The Monetary Order

Bitcoin is the global settlement layer.

It is slow by design.  
It is conservative by necessity.  
Its immutability is its purpose.

Bitcoin is not broken.  
Bitcoin does not need to be fixed.

Bitcoin is the reference point.

---

## The Role of Kaspa

Kaspa is a Proof-of-Work network designed for fast transaction flow.

Kaspa does not attempt to replace Bitcoin.  
Kaspa does not challenge Bitcoin’s monetary role.

Kaspa exists because Bitcoin should not be fast.

Kaspa provides circulation.  
Bitcoin provides settlement.

This is not competition.  
This is division of responsibility.

---

## Why Mainstay Exists

Kaspa provides speed.  
Bitcoin provides permanence.

Mainstay exists to bind these properties together without altering either system.

Mainstay periodically commits cryptographic summaries of Kaspa’s finalized state into Bitcoin.

These commitments do not move assets.  
They do not lock funds.  
They do not create claims.  

They record history.

## What Mainstay Is

Mainstay is a historical anchoring protocol.

It provides:

- Verifiable proof of past Kaspa state
- Bitcoin-based timestamp finality
- Long-term historical integrity
- Independent verification

Mainstay does not require trust.

---

## What Mainstay Is Not

Mainstay is not:

- A blockchain
- A token
- A bridge
- A governance system
- A financial product
- A platform
- A business

Mainstay does not seek adoption.  
Mainstay does not seek influence.  
Mainstay does not seek growth.

Mainstay seeks correctness.

---

## Design Discipline

Mainstay follows a single rule:

> If a feature is not required to anchor Kaspa history to Bitcoin, it must not exist.

Simplicity is security.  
Restraint is stability.

---

## Neutrality

Mainstay belongs to no network, no company, and no individual.

Anyone may publish anchors.  
Anyone may verify anchors.  

No party is required to operate Mainstay for it to remain valid.

If Mainstay ceases to exist, all anchors already recorded on Bitcoin remain verifiable forever.

---

## Longevity

Mainstay does not optimize for excitement.  
Mainstay does not optimize for popularity.  
Mainstay does not optimize for speculation.

Mainstay optimizes for permanence.

---

## Closing Statement

Bitcoin remains the settlement layer.  
Kaspa remains the transaction layer.  
Mainstay binds their histories.

Mainstay does not redefine money.

Mainstay preserves it.
